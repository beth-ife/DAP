# Dear African Parents
Consider this an open letter to African parents. 

The goal is to collate stories/articles into a book. The target market would be African parents. 

**We all have beef with them, so let's collectively write a letter!**

You can contibute by creating a topic as an issue [here](https://github.com/beth-ife/dear-african-parents/issues/new) or by commenting with your story under an issue/topic already created by someone else [here](https://github.com/beth-ife/dear-african-parents/issues).

Oh! and... **don't forget to tweet about this**... :D

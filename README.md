# Dear African Parents
Consider this an open letter to African parents. 

The goal is to collate stories/articles into a book. The target market would be African parents. 

We all have beef with them, so let's collectively write a letter!

You can contibute by creating a topic as an issue or commenting with your story under an issue/topic already created by someone else.
